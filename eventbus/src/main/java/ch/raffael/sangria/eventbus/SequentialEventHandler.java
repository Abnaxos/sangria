/**
 * Marks an event handler or event object as asynchronous. Normally, the event bus will make sure that handlers receive
 * events in the same order they were posted. Marking a handler with `@Asynchronous` tells the event bus that this
 * handler doesn't care. Marking an event class with `@Asynchronous` tells the event bus that the order of events is
 * generally not important for this type of event.
 *
 * The event bus implementation does not need to respect this annotation in any way.
